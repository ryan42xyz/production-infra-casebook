# Production Infra Casebook

Case studies and postmortems from production infrastructure work. Real incidents, real tradeoffs, real lessons.

## What this repo is

A structured collection of technical case studies. Each case documents context, problem, investigation, solution, and lessons. No theory without practice. No polish without substance.

## Case structure

- **Context** — system, scale, team
- **Problem** — what broke, what was at risk
- **Investigation** — how we debugged, what we found
- **Tradeoffs** — options considered, why we chose X
- **Solution** — what we did, rollout plan
- **Lessons** — what we changed, metrics improved
